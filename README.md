# Billit

Billit is a point-of-sale and retail management app for billing, inventory, GST, reporting, backups, and printer workflows. It uses Hive for local data storage and includes billing, inventory, reporting, backup, and printer workflows.

## Features

### Billing and invoices

- Search the product catalog and add items to a shopping cart.
- Track quantities against available stock and prevent adding more than the remaining stock.
- Enter customer name and phone number, apply a discount, and choose Cash, Card, or UPI.
- Calculate the sale total, product cost, and profit; completing a sale records the invoice and updates stock.
- Browse saved invoices, edit or delete an invoice, and generate a PDF or print a receipt.
- Look up customers by name, phone number or invoice number. Customers are grouped by phone number, show visits, total spent and last purchase, and can be sorted (recent, top spenders, most visits, A-Z) or filtered (repeat customers, reward ready). Tap a customer for their stats, favourite products, loyalty card and invoices.

### Loyalty program

- Admins switch the program on under Archive > Account & Settings > Loyalty Program and choose how many purchases earn a reward, what the reward is (percent off, flat amount off, a free product from the catalogue, or a custom gift such as free gift wrap), an optional minimum bill, and whether past purchases count.
- Customers are tracked by phone number (the last 10 digits, so `+91 98765 43210` and `9876543210` are the same customer). Every saved invoice counts as one purchase.
- Billing shows the customer's progress as soon as the phone number is entered. When a reward is waiting, an **Apply** button adds the discount to the bill; changing the phone number or typing a discount by hand removes it.
- After a sale that earns a reward, an in-app message tells the cashier (with an optional WhatsApp message to the customer).
- Progress is calculated from saved invoices, so deleting or editing an invoice corrects it automatically. Settings and used rewards live in `app_settings`, so Google Drive backups include them.

### Products and inventory

- Add and edit products with a name, selling price, cost price, stock quantity, category, and subcategory.
- Organize products with category, subcategory, and unit filters; search by product name.
- Track products sold by pieces (`pcs`), kilograms (`kg`), or square feet (`sqft`).
- View the calculated difference between selling and cost prices while editing a product.

### Sales reports

- Review daily sales summaries; admins can also view monthly and yearly summaries and navigate to other reporting periods.
- See revenue, profit, and invoice counts for the selected reporting period.
- Browse recorded sales and access invoice actions from the report views.

### Expenses and employee payroll

- Record business expenses with an amount, description, date, and category.
- Use built-in expense categories such as rent, utilities, transport, supplies, maintenance, and miscellaneous, or add a category.
- Browse expenses for Today, This month, Last month, This year, All time or a custom date range, with the total, entry count and average. A category breakdown (tap a category to filter), search by note, category or amount, and sorting by date or amount are included; tap an entry for details or to delete it.
- Export what is on screen as a CSV (opens in Excel or Google Sheets) or a PDF report with a summary, category table and full list.
- Add employees as daily-wage or monthly-salary staff, set their pay amount, edit their pay type or amount, and delete employee records.
- Record daily wage payments and monthly salary payments, with summaries of employees and payments for the current day or month.
- Review payroll/expense totals by day, month, or year, including daily wages, monthly salaries, other expenses, and net expenses.

### Backup, printer, and account tools

- Back up products, sales, expenses, and employee records to Google Drive, browse available backups, and restore a selected backup.
- Configure recurring Google Drive backups by interval. Restoring replaces current business data, so keep a current backup before restoring.
- Scan paired Bluetooth devices and select a default thermal printer.
- Change account passwords through the admin account.
- Access the in-app Help and FAQ.

### Accounts and access

- Admin and worker accounts are seeded on first launch.
- Admins have access to the Archive area for expenses, payroll, backups, customer lookup, and account tools. Workers see the Billing, Products, and Reports tabs, with daily reports.

## Requirements

- Flutter SDK with Dart **3.3 or later**
- A supported Flutter target, such as Chrome or an Android device/emulator

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository and open the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   # Web
   flutter run -d chrome

   # Android (replace with your connected device or emulator ID)
   flutter run -d <device-id>
   ```

On first launch, the app creates these local accounts:

| Role | Username | Initial password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin` | `admin123` |
| Worker | `worker` | `worker123` |

These are default credentials for a new local installation. Change the admin password after signing in, and do not use these credentials for a shared or production deployment.

## Development

Hive adapters are checked into `lib/models/`. After changing a Hive model, regenerate the adapters:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Run the test suite with:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Project structure

```text
lib/
  models/       Hive data models and generated adapters
  screens/      App screens and feature tabs
  services/     Authentication, billing, backups, PDFs, and printing
  widgets/      Reusable UI components
  main.dart     App initialization and root widget
test/           Flutter tests
assets/         App icons and other bundled assets
```

## Data and backups

The app stores business data locally with Hive. Export backups regularly and store them somewhere safe. Google Drive backup requires signing in to a Google account and an available Google Sign-In configuration for the target platform.

## Android launcher icon

The Android launcher icon is generated from `assets/icon/billit_icon.png` using the
`flutter_launcher_icons` configuration in `pubspec.yaml`. After changing the
icon artwork or launcher-icon configuration, regenerate the Android resources:

```powershell
flutter pub get
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
flutter clean
flutter build apk --release
```

If an already-installed Android launcher continues showing the previous icon,
uninstall the old Billit app before installing the newly built APK. Some launchers
cache application icons.
